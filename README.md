# Basics of container runtime

## Unix fork and exec model

In Unix, typically new processes are created using fork and exec model. For example, look at [fork_and_exec.c](fork_exec/fork_and_exec.c)

```
cd fork_exec/

make

echo $$
24882
```

You first confirm the process id of the shell you are running in. And, then. 

```
./bin/fork_and_exec echo hello world

Parent (PID=2620) created child with PID 2621
Parent (PID=2620; PPID=24882) waiting on it's child

Child  (PID=2621) exists with parent PID=2620
hello world
```

Here you can see that initially our program `fork_and_exec` is created with a PID of `2620` but it's itself fork'd and exec'd by the shell, it's Parent PID `24882` is that of the shell from previous output. It creates a fork's child with PID of `2621` and then, waits for child to finish before returning back to shell.

## Introducing namespaces

A  namespace  wraps  a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.  Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are invisible to other processes.  One use of namespaces is to implement containers.

       Linux provides the following namespaces:

       Namespace   Constant          Isolates
       Cgroup      CLONE_NEWCGROUP   Cgroup root directory
       IPC         CLONE_NEWIPC      System V IPC, POSIX message queues
       Network     CLONE_NEWNET      Network devices, stacks, ports, etc.
       Mount       CLONE_NEWNS       Mount points
       PID         CLONE_NEWPID      Process IDs
       User        CLONE_NEWUSER     User and group IDs
       UTS         CLONE_NEWUTS      Hostname and NIS domain name

Linux glibc provides `fork()` as a wrapper around `clone()` system call. So, in effect, we can substitute `clone()` in our previous example with no change in functionality. This is what we are going to next. We have created a simple function in [ns_child_exec.c](pid_namespace/ns_child_exec.c) which lets us supply various flags to create multiple different namespaces and run an arbitrary command inside the newly created namespace(s).

```
cd ../pid_namespace/

make

./bin/ns_child_exec -h

Usage: ./bin/ns_child_exec [options] cmd [arg...]
Options can be:
    -i   new IPC namespace
    -m   new mount namespace
    -n   new network namespace
    -p   new PID namespace
    -u   new UTS namespace
    -U   new user namespace
    -v   Display verbose messages
```

### PID namespace

We are going to use this utility to run our `fork_and_exec` program inside a new `PID` namespace (by passing `-p` flag, `-v` for verbose output).

```
# cd back into fork_exec folder
cd -

# In order to create new namespaces, we need admin privileges

sudo ../pid_namespace/bin/ns_child_exec -vp ./bin/fork_and_exec echo hello world
../pid_namespace/bin/ns_child_exec [PID: 6357]: PID of child created by clone() is 6358
Parent (PID=1) created child with PID 2
Parent (PID=1; PPID=0) waiting on it's child

Child  (PID=2) exists with parent PID=1
hello world
../pid_namespace/bin/ns_child_exec: terminating
```

So, we have 3 generations of processes now.

```
Global namespace: 
ns_child_exec [PID 6357]    -> fork_and_exec [PID 6358, PPID 6357]

New namespace: 
                            -> fork_and_exec [PID 1, PPID 0] -> echo [PID 2, PPID 1]
```

So, even though `fork_and_exec` program has a PID 6358 in the global PID namespace, but it starts off with PID 1 in the newly created PID namespace.

### UTS Namespace

We can similarly pass a different flag `-u` to create a new UTS namespace and see how we can change the hostname of the process inside the container without changing the hostname on the parent/global namespace

```
# create a new UTS namespace and execute bash shell inside it

sudo ../pid_namespace/bin/ns_child_exec -u bash

# current hostname (inherited from global namespace)
hostname
sharadg-mint

# change to a new value and look it up again
hostname dummy-container

hostname
dummy-container

# exit out of container
exit

# lookup the hostname in the global namespace
hostname
sharadg-mint
```

### Network, PID, User namespaces

Combining all these namespaces, plus PID and UTS namespaces is what ultimately you can use to isolate your processes in sandboxes, called "containers". Even though there is no such terminology for containers inside Linux kernel, but using these constructs in addition to cgroups and chroot/pivot_root system calls, you can create enough of an abstraction that you can collectively call the sandboxed process a container. But, before we create our own containers, let's briefly discuss cgroups.

## cgroups - Isolate and manage resources

(This section is derived from article [chroot, cgroups and namespaces â€” An overview](https://itnext.io/chroot-cgroups-and-namespaces-an-overview-37124d995e3d)).

Control groups(cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature which limits, isolates and measures resource usage of a group of processes. Resources quotas for memory, CPU, network and IO can be set. These were made part of Linux kernel in Linux 2.6.24.

```
# Use cgcreate, cgexec and cgdelete to create, use and delete cgroup controllers

sudo cgcreate -g memory:myapp_mem

# change to root
sudo -i

# cd to cgroup folder that we just created
cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/myapp_mem/

# disable swapping
echo 0 > memory.swappiness

# set memory limit (bytes)
echo 5242880 > memory.limit_in_bytes

# read it back to confirm
cat memory.limit_in_bytes 
5242880

cat memory.swappiness 
0
```

Without setting any cgroup limits, we can run our sample program [cgroup_demo.c](cgroup/cgroup_demo.c) and notice that it's able to allocate 50 MB memory.

```
./bin/cgroup_demo 
Allocated 0 MB
Allocated 1 MB
Allocated 2 MB
Allocated 3 MB
...
Allocated 46 MB
Allocated 47 MB
Allocated 48 MB
Allocated 49 MB
Finished allocation
```

Now, we run it inside our newly created cgroup `myapp_mem` after setting up memory constraints on the cgroup.

```
sudo cgexec -g memory:myapp_mem ./bin/cgroup_demo 
Allocated 1 MB
Allocated 2 MB
Allocated 3 MB
Allocated 4 MB
Killed

# delete the cgroup once done
sudo cgdelete -g memory:myapp_mem
```


# Next up - chroot, veth pairs and root filesystem

Now, that we understand how namespaces lets our processes run in their own little sandboxes, next we are going to look into how to make these sandboxes into cages where we can put more deterministic boundaries on them in terms of resource constraints (CPU, Memory) and that they cannot get out of (encapsulating in their own root disk).


## Start off with a rootfs

We can use [debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap) to create a container rootfs from scratch or we can cheat by running a docker image and exporting the image from resulting container for faster iteration.

```
# we will start off with a base docker image of ubuntu:18.04
# and then install few utilities on top of that image

docker run -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash

root@3124a4d24703:/# apt-get update -y && apt-get install less jq net-tools iputils-ping iproute2 netcat nano telnet

...

# exit out of the container

root@3124a4d24703:/# exit
exit
```

Next up, take a `docker export` of the stopped container that we will use as our root filesystem

```
# Look for container id
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
3124a4d24703        ubuntu:18.04               "/bin/bash"              6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 4 seconds ago                       distracted_einstein

# take an export
docker export 3124a4d24703 > rootfs.tar

# make a local folder and untar the contents
mkdir rootfs
tar xvf rootfs.tar -C ./rootfs

```
